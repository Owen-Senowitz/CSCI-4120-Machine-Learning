This program uitizes KElbowVisualizer to implement the "elbow" method in order to determine the optimal number of clusters by fitting the K-means model for a range of K values from 1-10 with 4 clusters of points. The elbow graph for this data set shows that K=3 is the optimal number of clusters.

#### **Important Libraries:**

1. sklearn
2. yellowbrick
3. matplotlib
